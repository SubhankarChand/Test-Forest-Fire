## Introduction
The **Test Forest Fire** project aims to predict forest fire behavior using a Ridge Regression model. The model takes input data such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and other environmental factors to predict the fire weather index (FWI).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- HTML/CSS (for the frontend)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhankarChand/Test-Forest-Fire.git
   cd Test-Forest-Fire
